# Code Refactor Starter Code (Marketing Strategy)
Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.


## Purpose
* A Marketing Agency wants me to create a website that offers different strategy in order to maximize the number of visitors to a website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine. "the key to getting more traffic lies in integrating content with search engine optimization, Online Reputation Management and social media marketing"

## Requirements
* The webpage needs to meet accessibility standards.
* When I view the source code it needs to show semantic HTML elements.
* When I view the structure of the HTML elements it needs to follow an independent logical structure of styling and positioning.
* The alt attributes need to be present when I view the image elements.
* When I view the heading attributes they need to fall in sequential order.
* When I view the title element I need to find a concise, descriptive title.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS


## Personal description
* Since you said that we should impress the client. I added a Pseudo-class ( :hover ) to enhance the esthetic side of the website on the Navigation Bar. But I understand that the whole purpose of the challenge is to keep the Website as Is and to organize it to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements üòä .
