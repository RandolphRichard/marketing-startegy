## Personal description
Since you said that we should impress the client. I added a Pseudo-class ( :hover ) to enhance the esthetic side of the website on the Navigation Bar. But I understand that the whole purpose of the challenge is to keep the Website as Is and to organize it to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements üòä .
